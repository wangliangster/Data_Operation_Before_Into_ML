This is a practice guide for data operating, which is a indispensable skills to feed data into Machine Learning Model.

As we know, before feed data into Neuarl Network model, you need handle various different format inputs and make sure the interface to your model is proper, sometimes make me crazy, inspired by proam's original summary, hope this helpful for you as well.
