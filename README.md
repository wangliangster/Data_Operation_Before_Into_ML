# Data Operation Tutorial, For Feed Data into Machine Learning Model Preparation
This is a practice guide for data operating, which is an indispensable skill to feed data into Machine Learning Model.

As we know, before feed data into Neuarl Network model, you need to handle various kinds of different input format, and make sure the interface to your model is properly, sometimes make me crazy, inspired by proam's original summary, hope this archive is helpful for you as well. 


### Environment 
- python >=3.6
- numpy 1.15.4
- pandas 0.24.2
- matplotlib 3.0.3
- Anaconda jupyterLab 0.35.3


### Vision

Maybe extend more operating guide to famous lib such as keras/tensorflow/pytorch/sklearn...'s dataset


# Acknowledgment 

Thanks proam who are original summary for this.

The project is inspired by [数据科学入门篇3：数据处理利器Pandas使用手册](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25184830) for personal practise to continue.
